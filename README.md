# Todoapp_with_authentication_and_permission

## This web-app named Dodis. 

I created this web-app because I saw that there were still many people who needed todoapp to help increase their productivity.
Dodis will help you to :
1. Organizing task
2. To be a reminder
3. Focus to the most prioritize and important task
4. Reinforces the information

## Features that I built in Dodis:
1. Create your first account
2. Creating various tasks (up to X-number of tasks)
3. Manage total of yur complete and incomplete tasks
4. Classify your task into categories
5. Modify your task (Premium member only)

## Monetization
To provide more service to users, I recommend 2 types of subscriptions and 1 superuser account (in this case, I treat the superuser as Dodis developer), those are:
1. Free account 
* Create new task (up to X number of tasks)
* Display list of all tasks
* Delete task as you want

2. Premium accout
* Modify your task (title, due date, category, is it complete or not)
>Premium feature is extra topping in our Dodis to user who need it. We can add other topping into Premium account features for next development.

3. Superuser
* Add new feature to our Dodis
